# Archaeology for QBCore

## Description
An archaeology activity for players. Using a specific tool, players can dig for rare items. Only certain grounds can be dug up. Item rarity is effected by the type of ground (Currently configured to accept most natural ground types)

## Configuration
* Set min and max task times
* Configure/Add/Remove items that are to be found + their rarity
* Configure/Add/Remove the diggable ground hashes + their respective impact on rarity
* Configure the distance between each spot that gets dug up by a player (Client Sided, Not Server Sided)

## Updates for later maybe
* A selling point for items - not included due to shops/selling/buying etc usually covered by an existing framework
* Server side dig sites
* More ground hashes + more range on rarity impact
